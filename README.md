# MCSBridge - MultiCluster Service Bridge

Welcome to MCSBridge, based on [Kubernetes MCS API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mcs-api), the Out-of-Box Solution for bridging services across multiple Kubernetes clusters. It is designed to facilitate seamless cross-cluster service communication, providing a robust service discovery mechanism that transcends cluster boundaries.

## Features

- **Super Alignment with MultiCluster Service API**: MCSBridge closely follows the upstream MultiCluster Service API, offering best practices for implementation.

- **Decentralized Architecture**: Designed with a decentralized approach, allowing any mcsbridge service to function as either a *master* or a *worker*.

- **Lightweight and User-Friendly**: MCSBridge is built to be both minimalistic and easy to use, complemented by comprehensive documentation.

- **Flexible Deployment**: Supports a variety of deployment scenarios, ensuring robust service discovery in complex multi-cluster environments.
